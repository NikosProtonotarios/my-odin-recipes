    <h1>Soutzoukakia</h1>

    <p>Soutzoukakia is a Greek traditional food that has its roots in Smyrna.
        The origins of soutzoukakia trace back to the Greek population of the early 20th Century Empire. This is a dish that was created by a minority population and survived atrocities, thanks to the hundreds of thousands of survivors who carried the recipe with them from Turkey to Greece.
